        <h1> Hello world!</h1>
        <p>Hello world, my name is Mimi Chen &#128513;</p>

        <p>Welcome to my new site for DGMD E-28, Developing Single Page Web Applications. I will be learning about Single Page Web Applications from sunny southern California.
        I recently moved back to socal, after living in NYC for over 2 decades. I went to high school here but previous to that, I lived all over the world as my father was in the Air Force.</p>
        
        <p>My major is in Digital Media Design and I have enjoyed taking courses for this program for the past few years. Through this program, I have been able to grow my web development skills and 
        love learning more. Most of my experience thus far has been in web development and very little in software development. A personal goal is to continue to add to my knowledge on web development and become more familiar and comfortable with software development. 
        I love the binary nature of this learning path (most of the times, there are either right or wrong answers: either the code works or doesn't) and having definitive answers is appealing. </p>
        <p>For awhile now, I have been wanting to learn more about single page web applications but wanted to first take the time to cover the basics: getting comfortable with html, css, and javascript. At this point, I am feeling
        pretty comfotable navigating around traditional web and ready to jump into the world of single page web applications. </p>
        <p>One of my favorite restaurants is <a href="https://dintaifungusa.com/" target=_blank>Ding Tai Fung</a> - I used to go to the one in Taipei and was so excited when they opened up a location in CA!</p>

        <p>I love good food, however, my favorite place to hang out or go for walks is by the beach</p>
