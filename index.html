        <h1> Hello world</h1>
        <p>Hello world, my name is Mimi Chen!</p>

        <p>Welcome to my new site for DGMD E-28, Developing Single Page Web Applications. I will be learning about Single Page Web Applications from sunny southern California.
        I recently moved back to socal, after living in NYC for over 2 decades. I went to high school here but previous to that, I lived all over the world as my father was in the Air Force.</p>
        
        <p>My major is in Digital Media Design and I have enjoyed taking courses for this program for the past few years. Through this program, I have been able to grow my web development skills and 
        love learning more. Most of my experience thus far has been in web development and very little in software development.</p>
        
        <p>One of my favorite restaurants is <a href="https://dintaifungusa.com/" target=_blank>Ding Tai Fung</a> - I used to go to the one in Taipei and was so excited when they opened up a location in CA!</p>

        <p>I love good food, however, my favorite place to hang out or go for walks is by the beach.</p>
